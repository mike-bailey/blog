<p><strong>I value my public library near my apartment a lot.</strong> It's a more productive area to hang out than something like a bar, and I can do everything from print stuff, go over papers, read or, at one point, listen to a dude threaten a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PECO_Energy_Company">PECO employee's</a> life.

<p>I have weird taste in books. Russian cultural, non-fiction, or professional development. Basically anything that either personally interests me or enriches me.
