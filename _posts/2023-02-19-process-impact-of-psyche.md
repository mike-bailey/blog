<p><strong><i>Ticket in, ticket out. Story points in, story points out.</i></strong></p> My work is fairly typical to the majority of engineering outfits. That's not to say my work is not exciting, it very much is, but it's got very specific parameters and processes.
<br /><br />
Any social and/or professional conflict I have is also somewhat typical of an engineer in my position. I like to think I've mitigated the majority of it, but it is impossible to avoid conflict wholesale. I work actively to mitigate workplace conflict, with online training, reading, and most effectively: routine career coaching. Individual contributors have a special obligation to mitigate conflict in order to ensure autonomy on their team. The less a people leader is required to intervene on an IC, the smoother a ship runs for both of them.

<br /><br /> Still, I'm more liable to attract conflict due to my work in ad-hoc workstreams I'm assigned to. These may include a random incident case, a hacked-together gap project or something similar as opposed to my longer product work which has much more easily advertised parameters, acceptance criteria, and timeline. It's a regular topic with my coach, and one thing that we've mutually come to meet on is <b>the interia of engineering work naturally produces conflict.</b>
