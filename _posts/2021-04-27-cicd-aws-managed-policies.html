<p>AWS likes to rename, replace, etc their managed policies a fair bit. Often, before for instance outright deleting one, they'll send a deprecation notice. But even with all of that, it's complicated as some people don't read their AWS emails frequently.</p>

<p>Like many others, I don't typically develop my code, policies, etc <i>in</i> AWS. Sorry, CodeCommit. What we do have is a CI/CD pipeline that runs against our CodeFormation. AWS is nice enough to have a <a href="https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-python-lint">cfn-lint</a> tool to check for common mistakes, and other third party tools exist for other things, but what about existing policies?</p>

<p>In my case, to avoid rotting managed policies, I'll regex </p>
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
