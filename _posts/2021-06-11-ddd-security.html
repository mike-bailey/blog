<p>Domain driven design, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ee658117(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#DomainModelStyle">as described by Microsoft</a> in a now "previous" doc, is:</p>
<blockquote>
An object-oriented architectural style focused on modeling a business domain and defining business objects based on entities within the business domain.
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, it's a pretty strictly software devleopment term. I don't intend to invent a new term, nor do I intend to fit a circle block through a square peg by directly indicating it's something internal security teams can "implement." I believe that would be trivializing it as a relatively complex style. It's also not particularly helpful to security teams.<p>
