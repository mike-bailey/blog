<p>Domain driven design, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ee658117(v=pandp.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#DomainModelStyle">as described by Microsoft</a> in a now "previous" doc, is roughly described as:</p>
<blockquote>
An object-oriented architectural style focused on modeling a business domain and defining business objects based on entities within the business domain.
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, it's a pretty strictly software devleopment term. I don't intend to invent a new term, nor do I intend to fit a circle block through a square peg by directly indicating it's something internal security teams can "implement." I believe that would be trivializing it as a relatively complex style. It's also not particularly helpful to security teams.<p>
<p>Nowadays I flip between security and development in my career. Part of this is becauuse I gravitate to the development community but the security work more, but I digress. I was Security Engineer, a Consultant, just an "Engineer" (dev), a DevOps Engineer, all within a couple years at Unit 42.</p>
<p>What I've found interesting is they seem to use different words to describe the same things, or vice versa. Maybe it's because they're (arguably marginally) different. Maybe because it's just easier. Maybe it's because they don't talk. Who knows.</p>
<p>Securty hardening assessments often target domains too! And not like michaelbailey.co domains! The ones I personally see, they typically target two (or a combination of) kinds of domains, a business domain or security domain. Let's look at a business domains. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/314834/business-domain-vs-technical-domain">This StackExchange answer</a> does a pretty decent job fleshing it out, with some bonus content on how it contrasts against technical domains.</p>
<p>And while nobody can seemingly agree on how many security domains there are...<br />

I like the (ISC)<superscript>2</superscript> on this:
<blockquote>
1. Introduction to Security and Risk Management<br />
2. Asset Security<br />
3. Security Architecture and Engineering<br />
4. Communication and Network Security<br />
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)<br />
6. Security Assessment and Testing<br />
7. Security Operations<br />
8. Software Development Security
</blockquote>

<p><i>*Please God do not take this as an ISC endorsement. I've heard several conflicting things about them.</i></p>
