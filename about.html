<p>A DC-area expat living in Philadephia, I live with my girlfriend and dog. To further entertain my own sense of self-interest, see my <a href="/">main site</a>.</p>

<p>A significant amount of this blog is dedicated to opinions I derive from my career. I used to write for my company blog, but in my current position (more back office) felt I should step back from it a bit and also like the flexibility associated with self-publishing. <b>None of these are employer endorsed and none of them are proprietary.</b></p>

<p>in 2021 I had short term living in Colorado (rockies) where I got engaged, Wyoming (tetons) and Utah (Zion). My family lives in London and NYC so I travel a fair bit. </p>
